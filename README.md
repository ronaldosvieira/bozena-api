# bozena-api
Bozena is an open-source tournament manager API built for *Taça Bozena*. It's going to be made with Java and Spring Boot, and will feature basic auth, users, matches and tournaments management at first.

### What the **** is Taça Bozena?
It's a FIFA tournament me and my friends have been doing every 31-Dez since 2010. After using paper and websites like [Braacket](https://braacket.com) to record stuff for too long, we decided it's time to have something more tailored to our tournament's demands. And since there's a freaking software dev among us, this is going to be the solution. In any case, this is meant to be a generic open-source tournament manager project so that other people may reuse this code however they wish. Oh, and Bozena was the name of my old dog (RIP), who had recently passed away at the time we started this tradition. Love you, Bozena.
